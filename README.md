# focus-tracker

## What is it dude?

So, this is me trying to build an app to help me tracking what I was doing

## What dude?

Did you ever found yourself in a work session or in a time that you are fully focus, working your ass and fingers off, pressing the keys with so much determination that even the ink's keys started to dissapear and then... 

## Then what??

Then something happens (your mom calls you to go dinner, your dad arrives with a full loaded bottle of Nutella, your girlfriend arrives home with that sexy skirt, your boyfriend tells you that he is arriving home early so that you two can... )!! **Yes, something happens!!** And yo got to interrupt your focus and your work, so you can do something else that just imerged in you "to-do-list"!

You leave your poor computer alone, and then you do what you got to do so you can come back and continue to press the fuck off the ink in those keys to finish the work you were doing, but....

## But...??

Then you sit, and you ask yourself: ```"What the fuck was I doing??"```

##My Main Goal

So, this is a real problem to me. It happens a lot, and while I do not remmeber what was I doing, I go to facebook, reddit, hackernews... And 15 minutes later I remmember what was I doing.
Well, not good enough for me.

So, my main goal is to develop an app that let's me suspend/sleep my computer and ask me for a message to show me latter, when I log in again

Aaaaand that's it.
